  abstract={The sensing chair project enables an ordinary office chair to become aware of its occupant's actions and needs. Surface-mounted pressure distribution sensors are placed over the seatpan and backrest of the chair for real time capturing of contact information between the chair and its occupant. Given the similarity between a pressure distribution map and a gray-scale image, pattern recognition techniques commonly used in computer and robot vision, such as principal components analysis, were successfully applied to solving the problem of sitting posture classification. The current static posture classification system operates in real time with an overall classification accuracy of 96% and 79% for familiar and unfamiliar users, respectively. The results obtained form important stepping stones toward an intelligent chair that can find applications in many areas including multimodal interfaces, intelligent environment, and safety of automobile operations.},

  abstract={Sitting posture recognition is essential in preventing work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). WMSDs are of huge concern for office workers whose working process is averagely 81.8% sedentary. Prevailing studies have utilized cameras, wearables, and pressure sensors to recognize sitting postures. The cameras and wearables can achieve accurate recognition results, while personal privacy concerns and inconvenience for long-term use impede their adoption. Meanwhile, the pressure sensors are privacy-preserving and convenient. However, they cannot accurately recognize the sitting posture with different states of the trunk, head, upper extremity, and lower extremity. Considering the pros and cons of those approaches, this study proposes a novel privacy-preserving and unobtrusive sitting posture recognition system, which combines a pressure array sensor with another privacy-preserving sensing technology, i.e., an infrared array (IRA) sensor. Moreover, a deep learning-based sitting posture recognition algorithm is developed, which adopts a feature-level fusion strategy and does not require a complex handcrafted feature extraction process. Based on the ergonomics studies, ten daily sitting postures with the states of different body parts are selected. This system achieved an overall 90.6% accuracy using the leave-subject-out validation approach based on the self-collected dataset from 21 subjects. It has a great potential for privacy-preserving and unobtrusive related applications for sitting posture management.},

  abstract={Prolonged sitting with poor posture can lead to various health problems, including upper back pain, lower back pain, and cervical pain. Maintaining proper sitting posture is crucial for individuals while working or studying. Existing pressure sensor-based systems have been proposed to recognize sitting postures, but their accuracy ranges from 80% to 90%, leaving room for improvement. In this study, we developed a sitting posture recognition system called SPRS. We identified key areas on the chair surface that capture essential characteristics of sitting postures and employed diverse machine learning technologies to recognize ten common sitting postures. To evaluate the accuracy and usability of SPRS, we conducted a ten-minute sitting session with arbitrary postures involving 20 volunteers. The experimental results demonstrated that SPRS achieved an impressive accuracy rate of up to 99.1% in recognizing sitting postures. Additionally, we performed a usability survey using two standard questionnaires, the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction (QUIS). The analysis of survey results indicated that SPRS is user-friendly, easy to use, and responsive.},

It also described the influence of an imbalanced sitting posture on the body. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects included 30 healthy adults. A pressure mapping system was used to measure the sitting pressure in the right, one side prone, chin propped, and slumped sitting positions. [Results] The WDI (XAP) showed a statistically significant difference between the 3 incorrect postures (one side prone, chin propped, and slumped sitting) and the right sitting posture. With regard to the WDI (XLR), there was a statistically significant difference between the right sitting posture and the one side prone sitting posture only. [Conclusion] One side prone sitting was found to affect the body balance most adversely. This imbalanced posture may have an indirect effect on chronic diseases. The results prove that it is important to assume a proper posture to maintain body balance.},

  abstract={Bad sitting posture is harmful to human health. Intelligent sitting posture recognition algorithm can remind people to correct their sitting posture. In this paper, a sitting pressure image acquisition system was designed. With the system, we innovatively proposed a hip positioning algorithm based on hip templates. The average deviation of the algorithm for hip positioning is 1.306 pixels (the equivalent distance is 1.50 cm), and the proportion of the maximum positioning deviation less than three pixels is 94.1%. Statistics show that the algorithm works relatively well for different subjects. At the same time, the algorithm can not only effectively locate the hip position with a small rotation angle (0°–15°), but also has certain adaptability to the sitting posture with a medium rotation angle (15°–30°) or a large rotation angle (30°–45°). Using the hip positioning algorithm, the regional pressure values of the left hip, right hip and caudal vertebrae are effectively extracted as the features, and support vector machine (SVM) with polynomial kernel is used to classify the four types of sitting postures, with a classification accuracy of up to 89.6%.},

  abstract={The LifeChair is a smart cushion that provides vibrotactile feedback by actively sensing and classifying sitting postures to encourage upright posture and reduce slouching. The key component of the LifeChair is our novel conductive fabric pressure sensing array. Fabric sensors have been explored in the past, but a full sensing solution for embedded real world use has not been proposed. We have designed our system with commercial use in mind, and as a result, it has a high focus on manufacturability, cost-effectiveness and adaptiveness. We demonstrate the performance of our fabric sensing system by installing it into the LifeChair and comparing its posture detection accuracy with our previous study that implemented a conventional flexible printed PCB-sensing system. In this study, it is shown that the LifeChair can detect all 11 postures across 20 participants with an improved average accuracy of 98.1%, and it demonstrates significantly lower variance when interfacing with different users. We also conduct a performance study with 10 participants to evaluate the effectiveness of the LifeChair device in improving upright posture and reducing slouching. Our performance study demonstrates that the LifeChair is effective in encouraging users to sit upright with an increase of 68.1% in time spent seated upright when vibrotactile feedback is activated.},

  abstract={Objective: The hypothesis that muscular states are related to emotions has been supported predominantly by research on facial expressions. However, body posture also may be important to the initiation and modulation of emotions. This experiment aimed to investigate whether an upright seated posture could influence affective and cardiovascular responses to a psychological stress task, relative to a slumped seated posture. Method: There were 74 participants who were randomly assigned to either a slumped or upright seated posture. Their backs were strapped with physiotherapy tape to hold this posture throughout the study. Participants were told a cover story to reduce expectation effects of posture. Participants completed a reading task, the Trier Social Stress speech task, assessments of mood, self-esteem, and perceived threat. Blood pressure and heart rate were continuously measured. Results: Upright participants reported higher self-esteem, more arousal, better mood, and lower fear, compared to slumped participants. Linguistic analysis showed slumped participants used more negative emotion words, first-person singular pronouns, affective process words, sadness words, and fewer positive emotion words and total words during the speech. Upright participants had higher pulse pressure during and after the stressor. Conclusions: Adopting an upright seated posture in the face of stress can maintain self-esteem, reduce negative mood, and increase positive mood compared to a slumped posture. Furthermore, sitting upright increases rate of speech and reduces self-focus. Sitting upright may be a simple behavioral strategy to help build resilience to stress. The research is consistent with embodied cognition theories that muscular and autonomic states influence emotional responding. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract={Poor sitting posture is one of the main inducements that lead to a series of skeletal muscle diseases. Sitting posture monitoring system can remind the user to maintain the correct sitting posture to prevent the harm of poor sitting posture to the body. In this paper, we proposed a portable sitting posture monitoring system to recognize the user's sitting posture and feedback the results in real time. A pressure sensor array is used to collect sitting postures related information, while the collected data can be displayed on a computer. The proposed system was designed to recognize seven types of sitting postures, including sitting upright, leaning forward, leaning backward, leaning left, leaning right, cross left leg, and cross right leg. Seven machine learning algorithms were implemented for comparation. The results showed that a five-layer Artificial Neural Network could achieve the highest accuracy of 97.07 %. To enhance system performance and reduce hardware cost, we further optimized the size of the sensor array. An 11 × 13 sensor array combined with Random Forest algorithm realized the optimal balance between classification accuracy (96.26 %) and hardware resource consumption. The final system prediction time is 19 us on the Raspberry Pi, which could satisfy the practical application requirement on the embedded platform.},
